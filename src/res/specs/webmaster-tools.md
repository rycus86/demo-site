Now that you have tracking on the website you might find out that people
*don't actually find it*.
Getting your pages to show up in *Google* search results could greatly
improve your chances though and it's easy to get started with it.

You can register your website on
[Google Webmasters Tool](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools)
*(for free)* to get their *crawler* to index it.
It will also display useful statistics about how often do your pages show up
in search results, for what queries and how many times people click on those
links to get to the site.
This could also help optimizing the website to make it more appealing in the
search results if you find that people don't navigate to it even if it does
show up on the list often.

To get started, *Google* needs to verify that you manage the website.
There are multiple ways to do it but having *Google Analytics* set up already
you can get the system to verify that the website has tracking code on it
associated with your account.

Once that is done and your pages are getting indexed and showing up in the
search results, you can find statistics about them in the dashboard.

You can also see other useful metrics and information about how the *crawler*
interprets your site, how often does it check it or any issues it has
identified.
