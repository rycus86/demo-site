# Development process

To have my dev laptop nicely organised and my tools kept portable in case I want to
switch to another `OS` or machine I tend to avoid installing anything on it 
apart from `Docker` and `Git` (though `Git` comes pre-installed I think on `Debian`).

To write `Python` code and related configurations (like `Dockerfile`s, `Bash` scripts, etc.)
I use the excellent [PyCharm CE](todo:link) from [JetBrains](todo:link) - 
in a `Docker` container of course.
Check out the [rycus86/docker-pycharm](todo:link) repository to see how to use it 
on (probably) anything with `X11` on it.
More details on how to run `GUI` applications with `Docker` check [this link](todo:link).
