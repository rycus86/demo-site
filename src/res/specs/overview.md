We can see on the high-level overview that there are three main types of interaction
between the frontend and the backend:

- `HTTP GET` requests from the browser to load the `HTML` generated by the **demo-site** app
- `HTTP POST` requests with `JSON` payload from *jQuery* to render `HTML` fragments 
  using another **demo-site** endpoint
- `HTTP GET` to one of the three **proxy** apps to get the `JSON` required for the fragment above

Each request will end up on the **nginx** proxy server that is the only application in the
stack listening to requests from the external network.
